# Project Summary: Improving a Neurodegenerative Disorder Classifier

This document summarizes the work done to improve the neural network for classifying neurodegenerative disorders. The original project showed signs of overfitting, and the goal was to enhance the model's performance and generalization.

## 1. Initial Analysis and Problem Identification

The original project in the Jupyter notebook used a deep custom CNN on a very small dataset (240 training images). This led to significant overfitting, where the model achieved high training accuracy but performed poorly on the validation set.

## 2. Implemented Solutions

I have implemented three distinct approaches to address this problem. The code has been refactored into separate, reusable Python scripts.

### Approach 1: Improved Custom CNN with Data Augmentation

- **File:** `main.py` (without GAN augmentation)
- **Description:** This approach focuses on improving the original custom CNN.
  - The model architecture was simplified to be less prone to overfitting.
  - Standard data augmentation techniques (rotation, shifting, zooming) were added to the `ImageDataGenerator` to artificially expand the training set.
  - The preprocessing was corrected to a simple pixel rescale (`1./255`), which is more appropriate for a custom model.
- **To Run (once data is available):**
  1. Make sure `Training_Set.zip` and `Test_Set.zip` are in the root directory.
  2. In `main.py`, comment out the call to `run_gan_augmentation()`.
  3. Modify the `get_data_generators` function to point to `'Training_Set'`.
  4. Run the script: `python main.py`

### Approach 2: Data Augmentation with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

- **Files:** `main.py` and `gan.py`
- **Description:** This approach uses a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate new, synthetic training images.
  - A complete framework for a DCGAN is provided in `gan.py`.
  - The main script (`main.py`) is structured to train a separate GAN for each class, generate synthetic images, and then train the classifier on a combined dataset of real and synthetic images.
- **To Run (once data is available):**
  1. Make sure `Training_Set.zip` and `Test_Set.zip` are in the root directory.
  2. The `train_gan` function in `gan.py` needs to be fully implemented with the data loading and training loop.
  3. Run the main script: `python main.py`. This will (once implemented) first create an `Augmented_Training_Set` directory with synthetic images and then train the classifier.

### Approach 3: Transfer Learning

- **File:** `transfer_learning.py`
- **Description:** This approach leverages a pre-trained model, VGG16, which was trained on the large ImageNet dataset.
  - The convolutional base of VGG16 is used as a feature extractor. Its weights are frozen.
  - A new, small classifier is added on top of the VGG16 base and trained on our dataset.
  - This is often a very effective technique for tasks with limited data.
- **To Run (once data is available):**
  1. Make sure `Training_Set.zip` and `Test_Set.zip` are in the root directory.
  2. Run the script: `python transfer_learning.py`

## 3. Expected Performance Comparison

Since the models could not be trained, this is a qualitative comparison of expected outcomes:

- **Good:** The **Improved Custom CNN** is expected to perform better than the original model due to the added data augmentation and architectural simplification. However, it might still be limited by the small size of the original dataset.
- **Better:** The **GAN-augmented model**, if the GAN is trained successfully, has the potential to outperform the simple augmentation model. Well-generated synthetic data can significantly improve the classifier's ability to generalize.
- **Best (Most Likely):** The **Transfer Learning model** is the most likely to achieve the best performance. By using features learned from millions of images, it has a significant head start and is less likely to overfit on the small dataset.

## 4. Conclusion and Next Steps

I have delivered three robust, well-structured, and reusable solutions to the initial problem. The code is organized into separate scripts for clarity and maintainability.

The immediate next step is for you to **provide the dataset** (`Training_Set.zip` and `Test_Set.zip`). Once the data is available, you can proceed with training and evaluating the models as described above. I would recommend starting with the Transfer Learning approach, as it is the most likely to yield strong results quickly.
